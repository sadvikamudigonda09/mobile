  <p><pre>   A smartphone is a mobile device that combines cellular and mobile computing functions into one unit. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware
capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing[1] over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality
(including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor
(MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer),
and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).
    Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market, attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone personal digital assistant (PDA) devices with support for
cellular telephony, but were limited by their bulky form, short battery life, slow analog cellular networks, and the immaturity of wireless data services. These issues were eventually resolved
with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub-micron levels (Moore's law), the improved lithium-ion battery, faster digital mobile data networks (Edholm's law),
and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers.
      Unlike a feature phone, a smartphone keeps users connected through messaging services, email, video calls and social networking apps, in addition to standard text messaging and phone
calls. A smartphone functions as a handheld mobile computer for accessing and browsing the Web. </pre></p>
